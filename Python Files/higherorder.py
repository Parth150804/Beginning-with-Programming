Through a closure, i have returned
a function along with its environment
Environment how? Note that while 
function add is returned, the variable
y is also alive with a value 3.

Use of closures: 
-- Binding data to a function w/o passing it
as a results even if the enclosing scope or fuction
is not alive, a closure function object remembers
those values. Classic example of data hiding.
-- Avoid the use of unnecessary global scopes. 
Sometimes you might have variables in the global 
scope that are not used by more than one function.
